<code>cow, in common parlance, a domestic bovine, regardless of sex and age,
usually of the species Bos taurus. In precise usage, the name is given
to mature females of several large mammals, including cattle (bovines),
moose, elephants, sea lions, and whales.</code></br> 
<var>Domestic cows are one of the most common farm animals around the world,
and the English language has several words to describe these animals at 
various ages. A baby cow is called a calf. A female calf is sometimes 
called a heifer calf and a male a bull calf. A heifer is a female that has not had 
any offspring.</var></br> 
<kbd>The term usually refers to immature females; after giving birth to 
her first calf, however, a heifer becomes a cow. An adult male is known as a bull.</kbd>
